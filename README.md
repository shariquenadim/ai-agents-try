# **AI Agents & Automations**
This repository is dedicated to exploring the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating real-world tasks. From generating AI-enhanced news insights to automated image generation, these AI agents are designed to streamline workflows and enhance decision-making.

## **🚀 Features**
- **Investment Insights Generator** 📊: Fetches news, filters relevant data, and generates a structured PDF for traders and investors.
- **AI Image Generator** 🎨: Generates high-quality images based on user prompts using Flux AI.
- **News-to-PDF Automation** 📰: Extracts news based on user-defined filters and converts them into structured reports.
- **Customizable AI Agents** 🤖: Modular approach to build and deploy intelligent agents for various automation tasks.

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**
- **Python** 🐍
- **Together AI API** ⚡
- **DeepSeek (Optional Enhancements)** 🧠
- **FPDF for PDF generation** 📄
- **Environment Variables (.env) for API Keys** 🔑

## **🔧 Setup & Usage**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents.git
